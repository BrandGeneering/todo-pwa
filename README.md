# first_pwa

This project is focused on building a PWA with React, CRA, and Node JS. 

## Tutorial basis

The tutorial used in this exercise is taken from egghead.io:
https://egghead.io/courses/progressive-web-apps-in-react-with-create-react-app

From egghead:

"Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) allow a user to use your web app online or offline, and lets them install the app onto their iOS or Android device just like a native app. Sounds great, right? But it can be tricky to properly configure a PWA, and not every feature works on every browser or device.

In this course, we’ll create an online/offline note taking app. We’ll use create-react-app to create the frontend, and node.js to create a simple backend. We’ll start by making sure the app can be displayed offline with cached resources, and learn how to persist data while the app is in offline mode. We’ll also interact with native features like the camera, and learn how to let users install the app on their phone home screen. Then we’ll customize the appearance of the app, including the app icon, splash screen, and phone status bar.

Finally, we’ll deploy the production app to heroku. By the end of this course, you will have everything you need to create a Progressive Web App with React."

## Starting the application in terminal
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  yarn start
    Starts the development server.

  yarn build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  yarn test
    Starts the test runner.

  yarn eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you can’t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd todo-pwa
  yarn start
